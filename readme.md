# Abstract

I want to make an bibliometric analysis of the publications made on the Microbiome-Gut-Brain axis. This project is done just for fun and I don't attempt to publish it.

The idea is to automate the generation of the report as much as possible with the only human intervention of downloading the new dataset.


I'm using [this published work](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9119018/) as a reference.
